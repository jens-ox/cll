# Component Library Library

The goal of this repo is to showcase different setups that allow you to share React components between repositories.

## Motivation

In most corporate landscapes you have multiple UIs that live in different repositories. In order to avoid duplication and improve consistency, common components such as buttons and dialogs should be shared across those repositories.
